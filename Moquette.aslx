      <description><![CDATA[{command:skip:(Skip to Act 1)}<br/>{command:skip2:(Skip to Act 2)}<br/><br/>Tuesday morning, 08:03. Waiting for the Northern line at Balham. 3 minutes to fill.<br/><br/>"Muesli. A delicious way to make sure today isn't one of those days". Right. Who knew a horrible breakfast cereal could have so much power? Maybe it just sets your expectations suitably low for the rest of the day. If you start off with disappointment, things can only go up from there.<br/><br/>"Become who you want to be. Get a place at Birkbeck". Good idea. Shame I don't know who I want to be.<br/><br/>"Meet someone amazing". Sounds lovely. You have to meet a lot of strange people first, by the sounds of it. One day I'll have to sign up though. Can't carry on like this forever.<br/><br/>"Feeling unwell? Seek help at the next station. It's quicker to ask staff for help at a station than pull the passenger alarm between stops". Thanks, TfL. Can your staff help me with this hangover?<br/><br/>The platform is filling up. 1 minute. On my left, behind the yellow line, a guy in a dreadlocks reads today's Metro - some tediousness about a report into child obesity. On my right, a woman checks her makeup in the camera of her phone. To her right, a guy in a bowler hat. What is this, the 1960s? Hipster twat. Shit, eye contact! I flick my head forward. Feels like he's still looking.<br/><br/>At last.

      <description><![CDATA[Pretty full as usual. No expectation of a seat, so I barely look for one. Space over by the opposite door though.<br/><br/>No challenges here. I just glide to a pole and grab hold of it without a moment's thought. No decisions, no effort, no choice, no problem.<br/><br/>Auto-pilot. It's almost a reflex action to the alarm clock, to get up, leave the flat, and catch the tube to work. Ten stops to Bank, change to the Central line, one stop to Liverpool Street. Turn left, up the escalator, left, through the barriers, right, up the stairs. Up the ramp and past the huge big rusty metal sculpture. Through the revolving doors. Rummage in pockets for security badge, and into the office. All automatic, and I'll barely notice a thing.<br/><br/>"Morning, Zoran" the boss will say, and he'll hear a reply. But he only sees the body of Zoran Tharp, and my mind will be elsewhere.<br/><br/>The day will pass, eventually, and I'll go home and heat up that second pizza I bought yesterday, then go to bed having hardly troubled my synapses in 16 hours.<br/><br/>Possibly the most exciting thing I will do today is go for a shit. Sneak off from my desk for 10 minutes of unscheduled me-time. Like a mini holiday.<br/><br/>The doors open. One person gets on.<br/><br/>This station is {command:1:Clapham South}.]]></description>

The train lurches onward.<br/><br/>Despite the clatter of the train, and the rocking motion, there is a peaceful stillness here. Many people in a small area, yet we are all alone. It is comfortable, in a strange way, even though I am standing up, having to hold on so I don't fall over the next time the train unexpectedly yanks left or right. Almost meditative. Almost soothing my hangover. Almost.<br/><br/>Like water droplets coming together and flowing through a pipe, the Tube carries us along, we are swept through from home to the office. It's automatic. Water starts at one place and ends up at the other, and so do we. We are packed together and become indistinguishable from a general flow.<br/><br/>This station is {command:1:Clapham Common}.]]></description>

That's all there is to it. I wonder what they think about up there. Their whole day just kind of happens for them. Not that different to mine really. An automatically guided train, taking automatically guided citizens to their workplaces, on schedule, like clockwork. Machines carrying machines. Is anybody conscious?

One man in a suit gets on, and the doors close.<br/><br/>I'll just be a good boy and wait here, as the train takes me ever closer to yet another day, a day that will be almost exactly the same as yesterday.<br/><br/>We stop in the tunnel again. After a minute, the driver's voice breaks the silence. "Sorry for the short hold up, we're just held at a red signal, we'll be on the move shortly". Well, that's useful information. Of course we're stopped because we're held at a red signal. Why is there a red signal though? "Once again, apologies for the delay, we're just being held at a red signal. We'll be on the move again very soon. When we do, this train will be calling at all stations to High Barnet via Bank". This guy clearly just loves the sound of his own voice.

You don't need approval, Zoran. You can make your own choices. Live at your own pace. And take those choices Zoran. Don't let other people decide what's best for you. Don't just follow what other people are doing. But don't just obey the whims of strangers either. You've got to seize life, Zoran. You've got to live it yourself. Don't let THAT person, whoever it is, say what you can and cannot do. Be your own man, Zoran. Live, make choices, do things, be bold enough to do something you may regret. Seize opportunities when they come. You know that often they don't come back."<br/><br/>Looking at the smoking carriage. "These headaches, these visions, is that something to do with you?"<br/><br/>"I wanted to show you, Zoran, how fleeting the now is. Life is full of moments, they come and they go, and they leave no trace. A tube train full of people smoking - so ordinary at the time, barely remembered now. Most actions leave no trace. Indeed, most lives leave no trace either. So don't be fearful, Zoran. Don't be afraid to make an impact, to make people know who you are. There is no correct path, there is no one route through the system. I hope me and my companion have helped to show you that."<br/><br/>Were you in this all along?<br/><br/>{command:1:I had no idea}]]></description>

Not somebody who is here today, gone tomorrow, chasing the next exciting thing."<br/><br/>"He needs to think about that. Yes, he can stay in this machine. Plug away, 9 to 5. The illusion of security is there. It's the same job his father did, pretty much. But he's not going to be happy if he just copies that template."<br/><br/>(after final) "Now if you don't mind, I think we are done here."<br/><br/>He turns back to the bank of monitors and starts typing on a keyboard. One by one, the monitors switch off. He continues typing and they switch back on again, with different images. {could expand this, who is Private Rod going to turn his attention to next? Maybe the player themselves - do they show somebody reading text and tapping links?}<br/><br/>It looks like somebody reading some text on an electronic device of some kind.
